Algorithm: PhysicsInfluencedCrossPollination

Input:
- IdeaSpace_A: List of ideas from Field A, each with associated 'potential energy' (innovation potential)
- IdeaSpace_B: List of ideas from Field B, each with associated 'potential energy'
- InteractionMatrix: Matrix defining the 'force' (synergy potential) between ideas from Field A and B

Output:
- HybridIdeas: List of combined ideas with calculated 'resultant potential'

Procedure:
1. Initialize HybridIdeas as an empty list

2. For each idea_A in IdeaSpace_A:
    2.1 For each idea_B in IdeaSpace_B:
        2.1.1 Calculate InteractionForce using InteractionMatrix for idea_A and idea_B
        
        2.1.2 If InteractionForce is attractive (positive synergy):
            2.1.2.1 Calculate 'resultant potential' for the combined idea, considering:
                - The 'potential energy' (innovation potential) of idea_A and idea_B
                - The 'interaction force' as a gradient contributing to the new idea's formation
            
            2.1.2.2 Map the combined idea onto an 'idea manifold', where its position and curvature are determined by its 'resultant potential' and 'interaction force' with surrounding ideas
            
            2.1.2.3 If the position on the 'idea manifold' is stable (indicating a viable and innovative idea):
                2.1.2.3.1 Create a newIdea with attributes from both idea_A and idea_B and the calculated 'resultant potential'
                
                2.1.2.3.2 Add newIdea to HybridIdeas

3. Return HybridIdeas
