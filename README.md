# CrossPolination
This script creates hybrid ideas by mixing 'Fruits' and 'Tech Gadgets' with potential energies. It calculates interaction forces between pairs, forming a new idea if the force is above a threshold and viable.

# Project Title: Hybrid Idea Generator

## Description
The Hybrid Idea Generator is a playful Python project that combines concepts from two distinct domains: Fruits and Tech Gadgets. By metaphorically applying principles from physics, such as potential energy and interaction forces, this script generates whimsical, hybrid ideas with potential for innovation. It's a lighthearted take on the concept of cross-pollination of ideas from different fields.
